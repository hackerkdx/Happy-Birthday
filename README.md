## How to setup

Here are the methods to set it up for yourself.

### Remote Deployment

- Netlify Deploy

   [![Deploy with NEtlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/hackerkdx/Happy-Birthday)

Remote deployment will require you to specify some mandatory environmental variables,

- NAME: Name of the receiver.
- PIC: Url of the pic to be loaded in the card. If don't have the image hosted somewhere, you may publish a [telegra.ph article](https://telegra.ph) with your image and copy the image address from there.

To know more about the environment variables, check [References](#references).

### For Local Building

1. Clone the repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/AnshumanMahato/Happy-Birthday-Card

```

2. Install dependencies

```sh
npm install

```

3. Add a pic of the receiver, in the `./local` directory. Ensure that the image is of a 1:1 ratio or it might get cropped and squished.

4. Create a `.env` file in the root directory, and add the following lines.

```env
 NAME='Name of the Receiever'
 PIC='name-of-image.extension'

```

5. Execute the following commands in order.

```sh
 npm run init-index-local
 npm run build:parcel

```

6. Upon Successful execution, your built files will be ready in the `./dist` directory. Serve this directory using `live-server` or similar tools to see your card.
